# hyprNStack
This plugin is a modified version of Hyprland's Master layout. 

The primary change is that it allows an arbitrary number of non-master 'stacks'. This can be changed dynamically per-workspace.

The layout is sort of a combination of XMonad's 'MultiColumns' and Hyprland's Master layout.

# Configuration
Default values are meant to produce a similar experience to the existing Master layout.
```
plugin {
  nstack {
    layout {
      orientation=left
      new_on_top=0
      new_is_master=1
      no_gaps_when_only=0
      special_scale_factor=0.8
      inherit_fullscreen=1
      stacks=2
      center_single_master=0
      mfact=0.5
      single_mfact=0.5
      auto_promote=0
      auto_demote=0
      order=row
      xfact=0.0
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration variable differences in comparison to Master Layout
*  `stacks` The number of *total* stacks, including the master.
*  `mfact` If this is set to 0 the master is the same size as the stacks. So if there is one master and 2 stacks they are all 1/3rd of the screen width(or height). Master and 3 stacks they are all 1/4th etc.
*  `single_mfact` The size of a single centered master window, when center_single_master is set.
*  `center_single_master` When there is a single window on the screen it is centered instead of taking up the entire monitor. This replaces the existing `always_center_master` and has slightly different behavior.
*  `auto_promote` After tiled window is created, add extra master if workspace has this many windows.
*  `auto_demote` After tiled window is destroyed, remove extra master if workspace has less than this many windows.
*  `order` The order slave windows are filled in. (row/column/rrow/rcolumn)
*  `xfact` X-factor, mfact for the whole layout, add extra margins to center any number of stacks using workspace rules (see below). Generic replacement for single\* options.

### Workspace layout options
All configuration variables are also usable as workspace rule layout options. Just prefix the setting name with 'nstack-'

```conf
# center single master and two stacks using 2/3 of screen when 1-3 windows are open
workspace = w[tv1-3],layoutopt:nstack-stacks:2,layoutopt:nstack-xfact:0.6667
# add third stack when 4th window opened and fill whole screen, auto split master when 8th window opened etc
workspace = w[tv4-20],layoutopt:nstack-stacks:3,layoutopt:nstack-auto_promote:8,layoutopt:nstack-auto_demote:6
```

# Dispatchers

New dispatchers
 * `resetsplits` Reset all the window splits to default sizes.
 * `resetoverrides` Reset all stacks/orientation/order set with layoutmsgs to config defaults.
 * `setstackcount` Change the number of stacks for the current workspace. Windows will be re-tiled to fit the new stack count.
 * `togglemaster` Remove master if window is master, otherwise add master.
 * `orderrow` `ordercolumn` `orderrrow` `orderrcolumn` `ordernext` `orderprev`

Two new-ish orientations
 * `orientationhcenter` Master is horizontally centered with stacks to the left and right. 
 * `orientationvcenter` Master is vertically centered with stacks on the top and bottom. 
 * `orientationcenter` An alias for `orientationhcenter`

Dispatchers can be used through `layoutmsg`:
 * `bind = SUPER, Z, layoutmsg, orientationcycle left right`
 * `hyprctl dispatch layoutmsg ordernext`

# Installing

## Hyprpm, Hyprland's official plugin manager (recommended)
1. Run `hyprpm add https://github.com/zakk4223/hyprNStack` and wait for hyprpm to build the plugin.
2. Run `hyprpm enable hyprNStack`
3. Set your hyprland layout to `nstack`.

## Manual
Hyprland plugins basically have to be user-compiled and loaded. You probably need to compile and install hyprland yourself (if not using a package that exports the headers, e.g. the one on Arch's official repos).
 
If your package does not export headers, see the [this part of the hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Plugins/Using-Plugins/#preparing-hyprland-sources-for-plugins)

Then:

1. Build hyprNStack
   - `make`
2. Copy the resulting nstackLayoutPlugin.so to some place
   - `cp nstackLayoutPlugin.so ~/.config/hypr/plugins`
3. Modify your hyprland.conf to load the plugin
   - `exec-once=hyprctl plugin load $HOME/.config/hypr/plugins/nstackLayoutPlugin.so`
4. Set your hyprland layout to `nstack`. 

## Plugin-Manager Hyprload
Installing via [hyprload](https://github.com/Duckonaut/hyprload) is supported.


1. Add the following to your `hyprload.toml` once `hyprload` [is running](https://github.com/Duckonaut/hyprload#installing):
``` toml
plugins = [
    "zakk4223/hyprNStack",
    { local = "https://github.com/zakk4223/hyprNStack", branch = "main", name = "hyprNStack" },
]
```
2. Reload/Update your plugins and set your hyprland layout to `nstack`.

# TODO
- [ ] Improve mouse resizing of stacks
- [X] Improve drag and drop rearranging of windows in and between stacks
- [X] Allow resizing of single master window
